/** Check if your application is properly configured to handle authentication and display Dropbox data. 
 @discussion You should call this message shortly after calling prepareForPotentialSessionWithKey: to ensure that Dropbox functionality will work in your app. There are three checks that this method makes to ensure proper configuration. First, your app must have a non-nil app key provided from Dropbox. Second, two schemes must be added to the LSApplicationQueriesSchemes in your app's Info.plist (dbapi-8-emm and dbapi-2). Lastly, your app must register its app key URL in the CFBundleURLTypes of the Info.plist.
 
 @warning Failure to meet all of these requirements in a shipping application will trigger a non-compatibility warning that may be presented to your user. In a non-shipping app, configuration failure will throw an exception. If you have properly configured everything this method should always return YES.
 
 @return YES if your application has been properly configured to use Dropbox. NO if there are issues with your configuration (please check the log for specific details on what went wrong).*/
